            <description><![CDATA[Dravid failing in coaching?

Does the Indian team need a foreign coach again...? 

This question has started troubling Indian think tanks once again, as India has lost a 5-match bilateral series for the first time in T20 history. West Indies defeated Team India by 8 wickets in the last T20 on Sunday. In such a situation, it is bound to raise this question before the ODI World Cup.]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA['WI series loss has shown us...': Rahul Dravid on India's concern' ahead of World Cup]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[&nbsp;

As India moves towards the Asia Cup and the World Cup, Dravid raised some major concerns for the team.

During Virat Kohli&#39;s white-ball captaincy tenure, in the period between 2017 and October 2021, India had an 80 percent success rate in ODI and T20I competitions, which included bilateral series and multi-nation events. After a forgettable end to Kohli&#39;s reign in the 2021 T20 World Cup, where India suffered a crushing defeat in the group stage, the Men in Blue&#39;s performances in the limited-overs formats have taken a nosedive. In the 27 matches played since then, India has registered a record 68 percent win. In this period India failed to make it to the T20 Asia Cup final before losing in the semi-finals of the 2022 T20 World Cup, while also suffering heavy defeats in the tours of Bangladesh (ODIs) and West Indies (T20Is). As India now heads towards the Asia Cup in September and then the ODI World Cup at home, head coach Rahul Dravid highlighted some &quot;major concerns&quot; for the team in the wake of the horrific T20I series defeat against the West Indies.]]></description>
